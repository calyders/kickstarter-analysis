# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis was to find how other campaigns, namely plays, in the Kickstarter sheet performed and how that relates to both their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- A line chart was created to visualize the relation between launch date and the outcome of exactly 1,369 plays. The possible outcomes were successful, failed, and canceled. According to the chart, the time between the months of April and August have the highest number of successful plays. May in particular has the highest number of all the months. However, likewise, these months also have the most failed plays. While there are consistently less failed plays than successful plays throughout the year, they follow the same trends as well, rising and falling in numbers at the same times throughout the year, more or less. The only time where there is a difference would be in December, where the number of failed plays rises while the number of successful plays falls. This increase in both successful plays and failed plays in the summer months is due to an increase in plays being released at that time, creating more data to calculate. However, the fact that successful plays have a bigger spike than failed plays do in the summer months suggests that this would be the best time to launch a play. This most likely is due to more individuals leaving the house at this time, encouraged by nicer weather.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
